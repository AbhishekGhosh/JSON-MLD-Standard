JSON-MLD-Standard
=================

The Concept of JSON Medical Linked Data Standard (JSON MLD), an indipendent Linked Data Semantic Representation first described by Dr. Abhishek Ghosh in 29th August, 2014 (IST) and licensed under GNU GPL 3.0 Compatiple License. This Github Repo is to represent the truth that Dr. Abhishek Ghosh first described or thought or modified JSON MLD Standard. My name must be mentioned while using the Linked Data schema for any reason(s) - simple webpage, web application, applications related to any device, representation of a journal / periodical, music or other creatives.

I can not publish the whole set now as the DNS propagation of Jima.in (an aquirement by me, known to be the oldeset Indian medical periodical on web) has not taken place.

For any conflict, decision of Richard M. Stallman will be taken as final.
